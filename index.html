    <h1>Welcome to my 'URL shortener MS' page</h1>

            
<p>This is a microservice which shortens the new URLs that are passed in, and redirects requests sent to these shortneed URLs to the right URLs </p>

<h3>
Example usage:</h3>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Pass in a new URL to be stored, and get back the shortened URL corresponding to this URL:
        (pass with a '/new/' route specified in the URL)
        <pre>
        e.g:
        https://warm-reef-87592.herokuapp.com/new/http://www.freecodecamp.com/
        {"original_url":"http://www.freecodecamp.com/","short_url":"https://warm-reef-87592.herokuapp.com/1482780504987"}
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Use one of the existing shortened URLs to get redirected to the corresponding page
        <pre>
        e.g:
        https://warm-reef-87592.herokuapp.com/1482780504987
        will redirect to 
        http://www.freecodecamp.com
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Use one of the non-existing short URLs (i.e. specify anumber which doesn't exist in the db)
        This will elicit an error response from this microservice
        <pre>
        e.g:
        https://warm-reef-87592.herokuapp.com/14827805049875345353453
        {"error":"This url is not present in the database."}
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Any other URL patterns than the ones specified above, are not being listened for, and will result in errors.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>
Following user stories are covered in this microservice: 
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
User Story 1: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).        
    </li>
    <li>
User Story 2: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.        
    </li>
    <li>
User Story 3: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.        
    </li>
